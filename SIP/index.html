        <h2>PAWS – Student Innovation Project (SIP)</h2>

        <h3>Innovation Claim</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>P.A.W.S. (Pet Activity & Waste Surveillance)</strong> is an innovative AI-powered recognition system designed to 
            <strong>detect</strong>, <strong>log</strong>, and <strong>communicate real-time pet waste events</strong>. 
            Unlike traditional cleanup methods or passive surveillance, P.A.W.S. utilizes a combination of 
            <strong>posture recognition</strong>, <strong>thermal imaging</strong>, and a <strong>visual mesh mapping system</strong> 
            to transform waste detection into <strong>actionable environmental data</strong>. 
            This approach provides pet owners with <em>precise awareness of activity zones</em>, improving cleanliness and reducing manual oversight.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>P.A.W.S.</strong> was developed to address a commonly overlooked challenge — 
            <strong>effective pet waste monitoring and management</strong>. Traditional methods rely on visual observation, which is 
            <em>inefficient, unreliable, and labor-intensive</em>, especially for those with mobility limitations or large outdoor spaces.
        </p>

        <p>
            The system uses <strong>AI-based posture recognition</strong>, <strong>thermal imaging</strong>, and <strong>infrared sensors</strong> 
            to detect pet waste events in real time. Each event is <strong>timestamped and location-logged</strong> through a 
            <strong>camera-assisted mapping grid</strong>, allowing for <strong>environmental pattern analysis</strong> and 
            <em>long-term cleanliness tracking</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the core of the design is a <strong>visual mesh of integrated cameras</strong> that creates a spatial awareness layer across 
            the monitored area. This enables the AI system to <strong>localize waste events</strong>, <strong>track pet movement patterns</strong>, 
            and deliver <strong>precise, real-time feedback</strong> to the user.
        </p>

        <p>
            Data is processed through a <strong>machine learning model</strong> trained using technologies such as 
            <strong>OpenCV</strong>, <strong>TensorFlow</strong>, and <strong>YOLO (You Only Look Once)</strong> for accurate object detection and event logging.
        </p>

        <p>
            The P.A.W.S. system delivers event data directly to the pet owner through a <strong>notification interface</strong>, providing 
            <strong>actionable hygiene insights</strong> without requiring constant supervision. 
            This innovation is currently being developed as part of the <strong>SIP311 Innovation Project</strong>, with a focus on 
            <strong>intelligent detection, mapping accuracy, and proactive communication</strong> to promote responsible pet ownership.
        </p>

        <h3>Code Repository</h3>
        <p>
            While this project is currently in the design and development phase, a dedicated code repository will be created as implementation progresses.
            As I continue learning and applying skills in AI development, computer vision, and embedded systems, this section will house source code, scripts, and system logic related to PAWS.
            <br><br>
            A GitHub repository will be made available soon to track the project's technical growth and allow future collaboration.
