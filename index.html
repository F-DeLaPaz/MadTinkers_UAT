        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <p>
            My journey has never been about following the traditional path. 
            <strong>I didn’t just leave school—I dropped out after attending ninth grade at five different high schools.</strong> 
            Structured schooling often left me uninspired, but learning? That was different. 
            By the fourth grade, I had already <strong>read our entire encyclopedia set</strong> and <strong>taught myself how to play chess</strong>. 
            I was soon good enough to start <strong>hustling money playing chess in Washington Square Park</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I made my share of bad decisions, landing in front of a judge more times than I care to admit. 
            Eventually, I was strongly advised to join the military, but when the Army turned me away due to my record, I didn’t give up. 
            Instead, I <strong>found a backdoor through the National Guard</strong> and <strong>transferred to Active Duty</strong> to bypass security clearance issues. 
            That’s just how I operate—I <strong>find solutions to problems</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I thrived in the <strong>structure and discipline of the military</strong>, specializing in 
            <strong>combat engineering, scouting operations, demolitions, and explosives</strong> in both <strong>peace and wartime situations</strong>. 
            I earned the nickname <strong>"Shaky"</strong>—because no matter the mission or obstacle, I was the guy to turn to. 
            How I got it done? Let’s just say, <strong>the ground would be shaky.</strong>  
            That experience taught me to <strong>break things down—literally and figuratively—so I could rebuild them stronger</strong>. 
            This mindset has carried over into everything I do, from <strong>fabrication and robotics to game design and writing</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            But I don’t just work with my hands—I <strong>push boundaries in technology, security, and innovation</strong>.  
            While pursuing <strong>quad degrees</strong> at <strong>UAT (University of Advancing Technology)</strong> in 
            <strong>Digital Making & Fabrication, AI, Robotics & Embedded Systems, and Game Design</strong>, 
            I concurrently attended <strong>Ivy Tech Community College</strong>, earning multiple industry certifications, including:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>CompTIA Security+</strong></li>
            <li><strong>CHFI (Certified Hacking Forensic Investigator)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>ITIL-4 (Information Technology Infrastructure Library)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Scrum Master Certification</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Six Sigma Green Belt (Aveta Business Institute)</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I’ve been <strong>building PCs since the ‘90s</strong>, and I <strong>graduated second in my class from ITT</strong> for 
            <strong>Electronic Manufacturing</strong>.  
            When I got my first <strong>belt-driven 3D printer</strong>, I didn’t just use it—I <strong>converted it to linear rails</strong> 
            and then <strong>designed and built my own 3D printer</strong>.  
            I forge <strong>blades and armor</strong> with the same attention to detail that I apply to 
            <strong>electronics, reverse engineering, and system security</strong>.  
            I’ve even spent time applying <strong>Mesoamerican linguistic patterns to the Voynich Manuscript</strong>, 
            potentially <strong>translating about 80 words</strong>—because why not?
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the most rewarding things I do is <strong>providing the guidance and structure that I once lacked</strong>.  
            For over <strong>30 years, I’ve coached and mentored young athletes through youth sports</strong>, coaching 
            <strong>baseball, softball, basketball, and football</strong> for <strong>boys and girls, up to young men and women</strong>.  
            I believe sports teach <strong>discipline, teamwork, and resilience</strong>, skills that go far beyond the game itself.  
            <strong>You don’t have to conform to the system, but you do need to find a path that works for you.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            This site is a <strong>collection of projects, experiences, and experiments</strong>—a mix of <strong>tech, creativity, and hands-on 
            problem-solving</strong> that has shaped my life.  
            Whether it’s <strong>building something new, questioning old ideas, or figuring out what’s possible</strong>, 
            I thrive in the space between <strong>logic and instinct, structure and chaos</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            So, if you’re here to <strong>explore, discuss, or challenge the norm</strong>, welcome.  
            <strong>Let’s see where the questions take us.</strong>
