        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I’ve never been great at following the traditional path. <strong>School bored me, so I left in ninth grade.</strong> 
            That kind of freedom came with its own lessons—some learned the hard way. I got into trouble, made mistakes, 
            and found myself at a crossroads. I chose the military, and that choice changed everything.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the Army, I thrived in <strong>structure and discipline</strong>, specializing in <strong>engineering, scouting, and demolitions</strong> 
            in both peace and wartime situations. It gave me the tools to break things down—literally and figuratively—
            so I could rebuild them stronger. After the military, that same mindset carried over into everything I do, 
            from <strong>fabrication and robotics to game design and writing</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, I focus on <strong>creating, exploring, and passing knowledge forward</strong>. I tinker with <strong>electronics, forging, 
            bladesmithing, and armoring</strong>. I develop <strong>game prototypes and write stories</strong> that push the boundaries of <strong>myth, 
            science, and human nature</strong>. I’ve even spent time applying <strong>Mesoamerican linguistic patterns to the Voynich Manuscript</strong>, 
            managing to translate about 80 words—because why not?
        </p>
        <p class="highlight">
            But one of the most important things I do? <strong>Give kids the choices and structure I didn’t have.</strong> I coach, mentor, 
            and try to show them that there are always other paths. <strong><em>You don’t have</em></strong> to follow the system, but <em>you do need</em> a 
            system that works for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            This site is a <strong>collection of projects, experiences, and experiments</strong>—a mix of <strong>tech, creativity, and hands-on 
            problem-solving</strong> that has shaped my life. Whether it’s <strong>building something new, questioning old ideas, or figuring 
            out what’s possible</strong>, I thrive in the space between <strong>logic and instinct, structure and chaos</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, if you’re here to <strong>explore, discuss, or challenge the norm</strong>, welcome. <strong>Let’s see where the questions take us.</strong>
