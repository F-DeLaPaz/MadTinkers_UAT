        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I’ve never been great at following the traditional path. **School bored me, so I left in ninth grade.** That kind of freedom came with its own lessons—some learned the hard way. 
            I got into trouble, made mistakes, and found myself at a crossroads. I chose the military, and that choice changed everything.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the Army, I thrived in **structure and discipline**, specializing in **engineering, scouting, and demolitions** in both peace and wartime situations. 
            It gave me the tools to break things down—literally and figuratively—so I could rebuild them stronger. 
            After the military, that same mindset carried over into everything I do, from **fabrication and robotics to game design and writing**.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, I focus on **creating, exploring, and passing knowledge forward**. I tinker with **electronics, forging, bladesmithing, and armoring**. 
            I develop **game prototypes and write stories** that push the boundaries of **myth, science, and human nature**. 
            I’ve even spent time applying **Mesoamerican linguistic patterns to the Voynich Manuscript**, managing to translate about 80 words—because why not?
        </p>
        <p>
            But one of the most important things I do? **Give kids the choices and structure I didn’t have.** 
            I coach, mentor, and try to show them that there are always other paths. 
            **You don’t have to follow the system, but you do need a system that works for you.**
        </p>
        <p>
            This site is a **collection of projects, experiences, and experiments**—a mix of **tech, creativity, and hands-on problem-solving** that has shaped my life. 
            Whether it’s **building something new, questioning old ideas, or figuring out what’s possible**, I thrive in the space between **logic and instinct, structure and chaos**.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, if you’re here to **explore, discuss, or challenge the norm**, welcome. **Let’s see where the questions take us.**
